# hello-world
My first GitHub repository! Can anyone say "n00b"??

I'm an aspiring software engineer from California. I've learned a lot of different skills throughout my life in areas such as design, drawing, painting, animation, web design, marketing, piano, and others. What I've recently realized is that my true passion is CREATION. I looove to create things with my hands. I love the notion that, when I finish a project, this thing didn't exist before I planned, designed, and created it. In recent years, I played around with front-end languages without ever properly learning. Now, I'm on a mission to learn both front-end and back-end programming languages with the goal to become a full-stack software engineer. I LOVE writing code to create things! It's like a puzzle and I'm so excited to join this GitHub community, learn from everyone here, and eventually contribute to others' learning!
